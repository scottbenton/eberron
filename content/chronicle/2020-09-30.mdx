The appointment of a six year old to Keeper of the Silver Flame four years ago shocked the continent of Khorvaire, as well as the nation of Thrane.
Today, Jaela Daran still holds the supreme leadership position in the church, although the Council of Cardinals currently rule as regents until Jaela comes of age.
By all accounts, Jaela is wise beyond her years, and is the most powerful vessel of the Silver Flame in its mission to defend the innocent.
The church claims that the child is capable of summoning angels, and that she even managed to resurrect a Cardinal after his untimely death, a feat that very few in the Church can manage.

With all of that being said, there are still many questions surrounding Jaela.
High Cardinal Krozen keeps many of the details of her appointment under wraps, including who the child's family is, and how the church discovered Jaela.
Krozen also seems to run much of the day to day around the church, performing tasks that would normally fall to the Keeper.

In addition to Krozen, the former nobility of Thrane remains in Flamekeep as well, although the position of Queen is now a formality.
Queen Diani irâ€™Wynarn, whose parents were the last true royalty to reign over Thrane before its transition to a theocracy is another trusted advisor to Jaela.
While Diani claims that she has no ambition to restore the throne, there are citizens throughout Thrane that would prefer to return the monarch to the throne.

We were not able to secure an interview with Jaela for this story.
