After picking up a few magic items from a shop in Thronehold, the group heads west towards the Eldeen Reaches.
Entering the thick forests, the _Greg Scott_ touches down in the city of Greenheart, meeting a druid there who identifies the head of the Gatekeeper Druids as Snappy Joe, a drow with a penchant for turtles.
Giving the group more information about Thelanis, as well as a carved turtle that belonged to Joe, the druid sees them off as they continue onwards to the Twilight Demesne.

Due to the fact that time passes at differing rates across the planes, the group decides to step into Thelanis only briefly to cast a sending spell to Joe.
Despite Joe not understanding the limits of the sending spell, they manage to get him on his way to the border between worlds, a journey that will take him two weeks of time.
After casting the spell, the group is approached by a group of satyrs on centaurs who want them to play a game called _Capture the Kobold_.
The party declines, scared of spending too much time in Thelanis, and leaves back through the manifest zone.
