Following the mutiny in the last session, the group locks Corric d'Cannith up down below deck.
Proceeding to search through Angelica's belongings, they find a chest filled with gold for the wages of the crew, as well as a journal written in a cipher.

Spending the time to decrypt the journal, the group learns the following information from the notebook:

> I’ve been hired by House Cannith to aid in the recovery of a few artifacts. Avanth and Klara d’Cannith await the delivery of these items in The Labyrinth.

> The first object, the Arcane Sundial, allows for matter to be transported between the material plane and Dal Quor, The Plane of Dreams. This object uses the harnessed energy of trapped quori spirits to make the connection. The quori, however, will not open this connection willingly.

> That is where the second object, the Gauntlet of Transposition comes in. It is currently in the hands of Leir d’Kundarak. Its role is to act as a catalyst of sorts, and will allow the captain of an airship to transport the ship through Dal Quor to its target almost instantly.

Using the knowledge gained from the journal, the group questions Corric, who tells them that Leir is located in Krona Peak, and that the original artificer who created the Arcane Sundial lives in Droaam.
After deciding that Corric should be left far away from society as to not allow him to tip off House Cannith, the group decided that their next course of action should be to drop him off in Q'Barra.
