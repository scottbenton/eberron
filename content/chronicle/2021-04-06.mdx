};

Sources within the dragonmarked houses have indicated that Darcy Deneith will face a private trial this week for his role in the death of Avanth d'Cannith.
Avanth was killed just over two weeks ago in an airship accident believed to have been caused by the disgraced Deneith.
Darcy is expected to face multiple charges, including mutiny and murder.

The jurors in the trial will be the leaders of each of the thirteen dragonmarked houses.
We have provided a breakdown of each of the leaders below.
