The crew continues their uneventful flight towards the Labyrinth.
Making their way over the Shadowcrag mountains, an entrance to the Labyrinth is found, and the airship flies forward into the tall canyons.
Looking for a place to rest for the night, the group notices a battle occurring at some battlements below them.

Making their way down towards the ground, they see a group of orcs defending their position against a band of demons that are assaulting the walls.
Aiding the orcs, the group fights back the demonic creatures, including a flying being who charmed Olivier temporarily into fighting for him.
Destroying most of the remaining demons, the orcs help snap Olivier back into his senses, and chase off the demons who remain.

Grateful for the help of the group, the orcs of the Gaash'kala offer them a place to stay for the night.
Rall, the leader of the small protective band, offers his help navigating the Labyrinth to the group.
