Returning to the _Greg Scott_ the group gets some much needed rest.
Waking up refreshed and feeling more powerful than ever, Lawsten restores the petrified goblin back to his natural body.
The thankful goblins are dropped off back in _Gorgonhorn_ as the party convines downstairs over the body of Anne, the old lady whose body was taken over by Belashyrra.

Casting _Speak with Dead_, Lawsten reanimates her corpse just long enough to ask a few questions.

1: Where do we find Belashyrra?

> Somewhere underneath Cyre

2: How did Anne end up controlled by Belashyrra?

> On the day of the Mourning, Anne reached out, willing to give anything to be spared from the mists.

3: What was happening in Cyre when you were last there?

> The mists of the Mourning were spreading

As the reanimating energy leaves Anne's body, Olivier slips away from the group, trying to negotiate with the eyeball creature for more information.
This, naturally, goes awry, but the group does learn in the process that Belashyrra is able to see through the creature's eyes.

The _Greg Scott_ sets a course back to Thronehold to claim their prize as the session ends.
