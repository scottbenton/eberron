};

Darcy and Olivier are summoned before Breven early the next morning.
Breven accuses Olivier of being a spy after reports of a changeling attempting to steal a Deneith ring were heard.
While Darcy convinces Breven that Olivier is dumb, and not malicious, Olivier is still banned from Sentinel Tower, and is escorted out by the Deneith guards.
Breven then returns Darcy's house ring to him, and welcomes Darcy back into the house.

A few days later, as the group prepares to journey to Korth for the trial, Darcy hatches a plan to keep them safe.
Meeting with Orvil, Darcy convinces him to fly the _Greg Scott_ away in the middle of the night, hoping to get the group to a safe distance before they awake.
As night approaches, and the group each find their way to sleep, Darcy leaves the airship, and Orvil takes off.

Unfortunately, the liftoff is not as smooth as Darcy could have hoped, and a few of the members awake, and learn about Darcy's deception from Orvil.
Convincing Orvil to turn the airhsip around, they plan to arrive in Korth before Darcy, hoping to keep him safe and testify if need be.

The next morning, Darcy and his family travel to Korth.
While Breven and Mariella rub elbows inside, hoping to gain some sympathy for Darcy before the trial, Darcy left outside.
Spending his time in an alleyway, Darcy is approached by his older brother Kaiden, who warns Darcy that his life is in danger.
Kaiden tries to convince Darcy to come with him, that they can work together to defeat their mutual enemies in House Cannith, but Darcy refuses.

As the set time for the trial approaches, Darcy is surprised by Milus on his way back into the hall, and the session ends as the court of the Thirteen begins its session.
