A group of halflings on dinosaurs quickly surround the ship as the Celeste Noir lowers towards the crimson hull of the crashed ship below.
The halflings demand to talk to Angelica, who instead requests that the group deal with the halflings should they pose a threat.
The dinosaur mounted halflings attack, and the group kills a few riders and drives off the rest.

As the Celeste Noir makes its way down to the wreckage, Delia and another halfling can be seen on board, trying to load a disk made of dark stone onto a sling strung between two flying dinosaurs.
The group attacks them, hoping to cut off their escape.
During the fight, Nishara and Delia have a quick conversation, where Delia warns Nishara not to trust Angelica, and that the disk they are fighting over is dangerous.
Delia escapes into the Howling Peaks as the group returns to Angelica with the disk.

Angelica claims the piece is a unique art piece, as it is accented with gold and gems inlaid into its face.
Olivier, seeing the gems, steals a couple from the face of the disk.
