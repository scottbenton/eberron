The group helps Delia slip on board the ship.
Nearly being caught by Aubrey as they approach Milus's cabin, Darcy distracts her with a training duel as the others squeeze into someone else's cabin.
Darcy gets utterly stomped by Aubrey, and is awoken by Benjamin, who fixes him up as best he can.
With Delia safe inside Milus's cabin, The Celeste Noir once again takes to the skies as it heads towards Gorgonhorn.

Arriving in Gorgonhorn, a goblin named Winsor approached the ship, and asked for help dealing with a cult group that had invaded the town.
With Aubrey in tow, the group headed into Gorgonhorn, and found the cultists milling about in the center of town.
All of them had eyes in varying states of growth sprouting from their foreheads.
The group decided to talk to the cultists, who took Winsor and began to draw an eye on his forehead, prompting combat to start between the cultists and the crew.
