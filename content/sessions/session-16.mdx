Departing the Mror Holds, the crew flies the _Celeste Noir_ towards Karrlakton, Darcy's hometown, hoping to meet with Darcy's father upon arrival.
Halfway into the first day's journey, the group is met by another flying airship, white with blue trim, with the name _Lune d'Or_ written on the hull.
Orvil lets the group know that they are signalling for a peaceful talk, and the group allows them to draw closer so that they can speak ship to ship.

As the two ships meet in midair, the group meets Avanth d'Cannith, grandson to Merrix d'Cannith who is the current head of house Cannith and creator of the warforged.
Also aboard the ship are Aubrey, who appears to have been picked up by her bosses, and Klara d'Cannith, a younger Cannith member.
Avanth accuses the group of stealing the airship and the arcane sundial, and promises to let the group walk free if the stolen items are returned.
The discussions don't go well, as the group refuses to return the dangerous sundial, and orders the _Celeste Noir_ to attack.

The next few seconds are pure chaos, as cannons from both ships rip holes in the hulls of both airships.
Nishara casts a _Lightning Bolt_ spell that knocks Avanth unconscious, as Olivier casts a spell that leaves Aubrey unable to tell the difference between friend and foe.
As Aubrey draws her swords on the people directly surrounding her, she ends up killing the unconscious Avanth.
Darcy and Milus focus their might on the elemental ring of the _Lun d'Or_, destroying it and freeing the fire elemental, and the ship drops from the sky.

With the wreckage dropping to the ground below, Klara d'Cannith levitates over towards the _Celeste Noir_, threatening the group with retaliation, and warning them of forces unknown.
As Klara leaves the ship, slowly descending to meet the ground below, the damaged _Celeste Noir_ limps onwards to the town of _Teryk_ for repairs.
