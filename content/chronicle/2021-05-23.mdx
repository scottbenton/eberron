A war was declared yesterday during a meeting of the Thirteen Dragonmarked houses in Korth.
Breven d'Deneith, the Baron of House Deneith declared war on House Cannith after an assassination attempt nearly succeeded in killing his son, Darcy d'Deneith.
Darcy was on trial yesterday for the killing of Avanth d'Cannith.
The trial ended with Darcy walking free, and while we are not positive at this time exactly what happened, Darcy was allegedly attacked by members of House Cannith soon after leaving the chambers.

It is currently unclear the scope that this dragonmarked war will take, but citizens of Khorvaire should stay safe and use caution while near dragonmarked house operations.
More dragonmarked houses are expected to choose sides and enter the war in the next few days, although none have made any formal announcements yet.

The last time dragonmarked houses partook in all out war occurred over 1500 years ago during the war of the mark.
This first war led to the founding of The Thirteen, and led to the normalization of the Houses as seats of power in Khorvaire.
This War of the Mark was not between dragonmarked houses, but instead was a war between those with established dragonmarks, and those with aberrant dragonmarks that didn't belong to a house.
People manifesting aberrant dragonmarks are believed to have been killed off throughout the duration of this war, and only a few unconfirmed references to people with aberrant marks exist in histories since then.
