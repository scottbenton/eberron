};

Our characters have received an invitation from Angelica Estrella d'Sivis to join the crew of a new airship, the Celeste Noir.
The characters are introduced to each other as they arrive at the docks in Sharn.

- Aalryn, a half-elf druid
- Darcy d'Deneith, a human fighter
- Milus, a gnome artificer
- Nishara, a kalashtar sorcerer
- Olivier, a changeling bard

As the group walks up the gangplank, they watch their new captain Angelica argue with a white furred tabaxi, and while it nearly escalates into a fight, the tabaxi Delia leaves the ship before it comes to blows.
The players are the last crew to arrive, and as they settle into their rooms, the Celeste Noir takes off into the skies.

On the first evening of travel, a small party is held aboard the ship to allow the crew to get to know each other, and the group is introduced to some of the crew.

- Aubrey, the first mate
- Benjamin, the ship's surgeon
- Silas, one of the guards
- Cheri, a mechanic on the ship
- Orvil d'Lyrandar, the ship's pilot
- Natsuko, the cartographer and an acquaintance of Aalryn's

After an enjoyable night of partying, the group heads off to bed.

Awaking the next morning to a storm on the horizon, the group heads to the deck to help prepare the ship.
After successfully making it through the storm, The Celeste Noir finds itself over the Howling Peaks, above the crashed remains of a crimson colored ship.
As the Celeste Noir descends towards the other ship, a screech rings through the sky...
