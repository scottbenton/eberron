Following in the footsteps of the creature that fled deeper into the ruins, the group descends further into the goblin ruins.
Tracking the creature through the elaborate, dilapidated architecture, they eventually follow it into the former throne room.
Getting their bearings and catching their breath, the group notices a few cultists, the tentacled creature they followed, and an old lady sitting in a rocking chair, who calls out to them as the enter the room.

The old lady reveals herself to be the All-Seer, a daelkyr named Belashyrra who has taken over the body of this woman named Anne.
Belashyrra, through Anne, has been gathering and warping these goblinoids in order to raise an army, just as the daelkyr did when they last invaded.
As discussion continues, Lawsten watches as a large floating creature with tentacles begins to to gather itself in the dark corner of the chamber.
As the giant, rotting flesh of a dead beholder looms into view, all hell breaks loose as the fighting begins.

The cultists under Belashyrra's control fall rather quickly, so Belashyrra turns on the goblins that have been helping the group, turning Myc into another tentacled creature, and merging Mytna and Ziggy into one conjoined abberation.
Gob, not wanting to befall a similar fate, leaves the chamber as the group mops up the new enemies, killing Anne and the zombified beholder under her control, Todd.

With the fight wound down, Lawsten searches through the chamber, locating a secret chamber filled with gold and riches that Gob can use to rebuild the devastated goblin empire.
