After soundly defeating a group of warforged, Lier and his Stone Defender step into the fight against the party.
Knocking out Milus, Nishara, and Olivier almost immediately, the two seem almost undefeatable.
Delia sets to work bringing the unconscious party members back to consciousness, while Darcy fights against Lier.
Eventually knocking the Dwarf unconscious, the group focuses fire on the Stone Defender, who Olivier eventually turns into rubble.

After bringing Lier and the Warforged back to consciousness, Lier hands over the Gauntlet of Transposition.
The Gauntlet, in addition to acting as a catalyst to the Arcane Sundial, allows for users to create duplicates of themselves that last for one round.
A user attuned to the Gauntlet can teleport to the duplicate's position at the end of their turn.

After getting the Gauntlet from Lier, the group heads down into the Dwarven city of Krona Peak.
There, they share some drinks and learn a bit more about each of the fellow party members.
Spending the night in Lier's place, the group does a bit of shopping in the morning, finding themselves some magically augmented weapons and armor.
