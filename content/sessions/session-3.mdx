The Celeste Noir, disk safely in Angelica's quarters, takes off towards the Gnomish city of Zolanberg.
A few members of the group who have offered their help keeping watch over the disk study its nature.
Suspicion fueled by Delia's warnings and Angelica's shifty nature, they learn that the disk contains significant magical power.

When the ship lands in Zolanberg, the group splits up.
Nishara & Darcy go to deliver messages to their families, with Darcy warning his father about what has been learned so far.
Milus heads to a local artificer's guild, where he meets Angelica, who is bringing aboard the local artificer, Corric d'Cannith to fix the damage Olivier caused to the stone.
Aalryn drops some dirt on the street, greatly annoying a gnome, who speaks in veiled threats.

After sending their letters, Nishara and Darcy sit down with Delia, who explains that the disk is capable of transporting large objects through Dal Quor, the plane of dreams.
`The Arcane Sundial`, as the disk is called, is dangerous due to the literally nightmarish nature of Dal Quor's inhabitants, as well as the consequences of allowing a large object like an airship to drop in on a target unannounced and unseen.
After relaying this information, Delia asks to be snuck aboard so that she can travel across the Mournland with the group, and meet with allies on the other side.

The group begins to make plans to sneak the tabaxi on board The Celeste Noir.
