The court of The Thirteen convenes a hearing to determine Darcy's guilt in the death of Avanth d'Cannith.
Darcy's aunt Mariella presents Darcy's side of the case, namely that the mutiny aboard _The Celeste Noir_ and Avanth's later death was a byproduct of Darcy attempting to stop the Canniths from using the Arcane Sundial to reignite the Last War.
On Cannith's side, Avanth's uncle Merrix d'Cannith presents a case against Darcy, bringing in Avanth's body to testify, and trying to make the case that nothing that Darcy said is justified.

One side of the case that seems to perplex both sides is the true identity of the shapeshifter posing as Klara d'Cannith.
Merrix is insistent that Klara d'Cannith is not, and has never been, a member of House Cannith.
Despite this, Avanth's reanimated corpse seems to believe that Klara is his sister.
This portion of the case is never resolved, and how Klara ended up working with House Cannith remains a mystery.

As the trial wraps up, the members of the thirteen dragonmarked houses begin deliberations.
Once minds have been made up, Darcy is returned to the chambers, and votes are tallied.
Overall, 7 dragonmarked houses vote against punishing Darcy for his crimes, with the stipulation that he must return _The Celeste Noir_ and other stolen items to House Cannith.

Celebrating their victory, the group heads down into the courtyard, and as they head back to the ship, a giant metal snake bursts from a nearby building, and the session ends.
