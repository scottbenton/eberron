# My Prep Process

---

I have three main tools that I use to prep for sessions.

1. A single page of notes for session specific story notes
1. DND Beyond for any and all stats & combat based information
1. OneNote, which contains overarching story information, backstory, character motivations, etc.

Despite this, most of my time planning doesn't necessarily come from these tools.
Throughout the week, I often think of fun things to add or change in the next session, leading to modifications in individual encounters or characters.
With that being said, lets break these down.

## Page of Notes

The page of notes is what I use session to session.
[Here](/Session12Redacted.pdf) is a redacted version of my notes from [session 12](/sessions/12)

The page has seven different sections

1. Summary: A 2-3 sentence summary of the previous session
1. NPCs: A list of NPCs that I expect to show up
1. Locations: A list of locations that the party could be at, and a short description to help ground it
1. Events: Possible events that could happen throughout the session
1. Potential Loot: Something to throw at the party if they find something
1. Random Names: Exactly what it sounds like
1. Hooks: Different threads that the party could potentially pull on

Most of these are fairly self explanatory, but I think that the hooks and the events are potentially the two most important sections.

Events is reserved for things that I think have a very high likelihood of happening.
I have planned for these events to occur, and I generally have a good feel for what and why it will happen.
Most of the time, I hopefully have a plan for how to transition the group from one to the next.

Hooks, on the other hand, are mostly just ideas that I have floating around.
These can vary from week to week as I plan and think.
In the Session 12 pdf, two-thirds of the hooks are hidden because the group hasn't triggered them yet.
The remaining hook is a precursor to the Wren d'Deneith mission.
As I planned this hook out further, the details and names shifted.

## DnD Beyond

DND Beyond is fantastic for planning & running fights and creating NPCs.
Kobold Fight Club is also a good tool for planning, but doesn't allow for running encounters or viewing the stat blocks of creatures.
I'll admit that there have been times where I have thrown together an encounter minutes before running it, that's how easy DNDBeyond's encounter features are.

## OneNote

OneNote contains all of the continuing information that continues throughout weeks.
Its a good place to store NPC information, as well as character backstory reminders.

One useful page I have just contains information about how different parties in Eberron relate to each other.
Pretty much just who is working with who, which groups are working against each other, why groups hate each other, and the like.
This is useful for planning out larger story arcs and tying more minor story arcs to a larger picture.
By creating a board like this, I am able to connect different subplots in a more meaningful way, as well as plan for potential future threats and story lines.

OneNote allows me to keep a cohesive larger story in mind while I use DND Beyond to plan encounters, and my page of notes to run sessions. In addition to all of these tools, a functioning DM screen allows me to have information on game mechanics and some worldbuilding information that I might need during a session.
