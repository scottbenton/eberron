};

The ship lands in Thronehold, dropping down into the waters on the edge of town.
Nishara, familiar with the area, leads the group through town towards _The Cranky Kenku_, a seedy establishment where the group hopes to find some information, and pick some fights.
As they travel the streets, the city seems quiet despite the daytime hours, almost abandoned were it not for the occasional drunkard left passed out in the streets.

Arriving at the Cranky Kenku, they meet the bar's owner, who informs Darcy of the fighting pits beneath the bar.
As the evening arrives, more and more patrons begin crowding into the bar, including an old employer of Nishara's known as Dutchess Volnia.
The fights get underway, and Darcy destroys his first combatant of the night, a red skinned Tiefling.

During the fight, Nishara and Volnia meet for a little bit, as Nishara requests information about the location of Cannith's base.
Volnia believes she can find that information, but requests that Darcy kill one of the other pit fighters as payment, a man named Calmorn.

As Darcy fights his second match of the night against a drunken dwarf who fights with her fists, Nishara and Olivier try to learn more about Calmorn.
Nishara learns that Calmorn is dabbling in magic that is unfamiliar to the other patrons of the bar.
He has been using this power to remain undefeated in the pit fights, angering many of the bettors in the _Kenku_
Olivier, using his shapeshifting capabilities learns that Calmorn is a wizard of some variety, but despite his best efforts to flirt with the wizard, is ultimately unsuccessful in learning much more.

The session ends as Nishara tries to figure out their next steps.
