        <h1>Scott's Eberron Campaign Resources</h1>
        <p>
          Welcome players! Here I will post different bits and pieces of
          information that you may find helpful in the campaign. Perhaps some
          notes on NPCs or locations, links to resources, session recaps, etc.

        <h2>Korranberg Chronicle -COMING SOON-</h2>
        <p>
          The Korranberg Chronicle is a newspaper that can be found all across
          Khorvaire. My hope is that by making editions of the paper available
          to you online, you can get a better feel as to what is going on in the
          world at the moment, and maybe even find a job or two!
