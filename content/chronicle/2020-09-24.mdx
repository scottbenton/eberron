Last week, I sat down with Seven, a soldier working for the notorious warforged criminal The Lord of Blades.
The Lord of Blades, a deeply dangerous creation has been radicalizing many warforged since the war began.
We sat down with Seven to try to understand how they came to be under the influence of this figure.

Seven is a warforged, created towards the end of the war by House Cannith's forges in Eston about 10 years ago.
Their purpose was to be a warrior, fighting alongside Cyrans on the front-lines.
Once the war ended, Seven claims they found themselves with little purpose, and found that the only employment available for a warforged was as a mercenary or as a machine.

Seven didn't want to continue fighting for other people, nor did they want to work under a boss in a factory, working as another piece on the assembly line.
"I wanted to work as a blacksmith", said Seven. "Humanoids didn't like the idea of buying from a warforged."

Unable to get a business off the ground, Seven eventually found like-minded warforged in some agents working for the Lord of Blades.
The agents brought them to the Mournland, where Seven joined the terrorist group.
While it is unclear to us exactly where the Lord of Blades operation is based out of in the Mournland, Seven speaks of an encampment the size of a large town hidden away in the mists.

Seven makes it clear that they felt exploited by the world around them.
"I was created to fight and die on the orders of my creators.
Now that there is no fight left, I am only expected to die.", stated Seven.
While many warforged shared this outlook in the aftermath of the _Treaty of Thronehold_, which outlawed the creation of new warforged, disciples of the Lord of Blades have taken it further, attacking House Cannith workshops and killing outsiders.
Seven, while now enjoying their role as a blacksmith for the Lord of Blades, has also taken part in some of these terrorist attacks.
"We were made as weapons. Let us be weapons."

We reached out to key members of House Cannith for comment, but have not heard back.
