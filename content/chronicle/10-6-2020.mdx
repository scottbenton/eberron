Most know of Q'Barra as a place settlers and refugees have gone to get rich.
The discovery of Dragonshards in the area, in addition to the chaos of the war led to a massive influx in new settlers to the area.
People came from across the continent to try their luck at finding deposits of the dragonshards, some bringing their families and friends with them as well.
Settlements sprang up overnight, some transforming into sprawling successful towns such as Whitecliff.
Even the dragonmarked houses have began to move into the area, with House Tharashk starting up dragonshard recovery operations of its own in the area.

Outside of the settlements though, the dense jungles of Q'Barra hold many secrets.
Tribes of Lizardfolk, previously unknown to the rest of the continent, haven't taken too kindly to the fortune seekers, and many spats have sprung up over the years.
Dragonborn, a race of draconic, scaly creatures with a proud militant background also live in the area of Q'Barra.
Despite the tension, an all out war has not broken out yet in the region, although tension has risen in recent years.

In addition to its lucrative dragonshard industry and interesting inhabitants, Q'Barra also offers another tantalizing secret: knowledge.
Our team followed intrepid explorer Illinois Johns on a raid of a ruin.
Inside the ruin, still active magical traps from the Age of Demons were found, and our reporting team almost didn't make it out alive.
Illinois, on the other hand, kept his cool, and managed to overcome the obstacles and escape the ruin with an unidentified magical artifact and his life.

It is estimated that little over 5% of Q'Barra has been explored, and some of the unconfirmed stories about what remains undiscovered in the jungles is terrifying.
