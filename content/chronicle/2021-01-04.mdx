One of the top mages at the Floating Towers of Arcanix, Magus Oleran Mooncarn, was killed in a terrorist attack yesterday.
While details about his death are still relatively sparse, we talked to a local barkeep who said that Oleran's body plummeted from the towers and crashed through his roof yesterday afternoon.
It is not currently understood why such a powerful wizard in such a high place would not have _Feather Fall_ prepared.

One former student, Kalia Greyheart, has been identified as one of the assassins.
This is not her first attack on the floating towers, and has been identified as the planner behind a series of attacks that left operations at the school hindered, and the locals terrified.
According to students at the towers, Kalia was joined in her assault by 4 other individuals who remain unidentified at the current moment.
Anyone with information leading to the identification of these individuals is encouraged to contact Sentinel Marshal Raymond d'Deneith in Arcanix.

Oleran will be remembered as a passionate teacher, and as a powerful mage.
