After questioning Corric, and realizing that Cannith is still after its missing airship, Corric is killed, and the bodies are burned.
Entering the Cathedral of the Silver Flame, the group heads to High Cardinal Krozen's office.
Meeting with Krozen, the group is paid for their efforts in Darguun.
Krozen also tells the group that while Belashyrra's efforts have been stalled, if they want to do more they can visit the leader of the Gatekeeper Druids, a drow living in the plane of Thelanis.
Thelanis is accessible through a manifest zone called the Twilight Demesne located in the Eldeen Reaches.

Leaving Krozen's office and deciding to visit Jaela, the group is pulled into a side room by a servant.
The servant reveals herself to be Klara d'Cannith, who offers her help in taking down Belashyrra, offering to guide the group through the Mournland.
Although interested in her offer, the group decides to continue onwards towards the Twilight Demesne.
