Olivier's friends Vulf and Dok, as well as a new member of their group, Finn, enlist the group's help in a heist.
Their plan is to sneak in to the house at night, and steal the object of focus, a small woven dinosaur.
Delia, completely comfortable with murdering guards, but not comfortable with breaking and entering decided to go trigger Milus's sabotage on board the Celeste Noir.

As night falls, the group finds their way to the house, and sneaks in through a window.
Winding their way through the house, the group shreds a rug, and destroys a few suits of animated armor.
Delving deeper into the house, they come across the dinosaur, sitting atop an ornate pillar in the center of the library.
Entering into the room, Nishara detects the presence of an invisibility spell, as Finn grabs the woven dino.
As Finn's fingers make contact, the pillar seems to morph, and large teeth bite down onto Finn's wrist.
