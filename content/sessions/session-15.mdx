After narrowly having defeated the creature that had taken root in Torlan Mroranon's body last session, losing Delia in the process, the group takes a second to take in their surroundings.
Investigating the chamber, Darcy found a couple of treasures, and studied the rune inset into the floor.
Learning that the ancient arcane symbol on the floor is acting as a prison to a Daelkyr, keeping the ancient evil locked in place, the group gathered up the dead and headed to the surface.

Upon reaching the surface, the group was escorted to the Mroranon household above, where the bad news of Torlan's death was delivered to his family.
Meeting his younger brother Parak, and his daughter Mirilan, the group laid his body, along with Delia's, to rest temporarily inside the hold.
Despite the late hour, an emergency meeting of the Iron Council was called, and the group was called to speak in front of the council, hoping to warn them of the potential danger.

After speaking at the meeting, with Wren, Darcy, and Milus agreeing to speak under a truth spell, and Olivier and Nishara having a rather awkward conversation with Mirilan, the group headed out of the chambers.
Stopping Darcy on the way out, Lier d'Kundarak informed him that another member of House Deneith had come asking about Darcy, and that Lier had directed them to the ship.
Darcy, assuming that his older brother Kaiden must be around, began sprinting back to the Celeste Noir, tailed closely by the rest of the party.

Upon reaching the ship, Darcy and the group learned that Kaiden had taken up residence in the cabin, with the guards too intimidated by Kaiden's strength to attempt fighting back.
Entering the cabin, they find Kaiden sitting in front of the Arcane Sundial.
A rather tense conversation ensues between the two brothers, with Kaiden trying to convince Darcy that an aggressive approach against House Cannith is a good idea.
The bad blood between the brothers too much to overcome, Darcy rejects the idea that they should use the Arcane Sundial to mount an attack, and tells Kaiden to leave the ship.

After staying up all night making sure that Kaiden is not sneaking back on board, Darcy sets out in the morning to collect payment from Wren.
Travelling from there, the group heads back to the Mroranon household, where plans are made for a funeral pyre for Delia. 
Taking Delia's body up to a cliff overlooking the town, Delia's body is cremated as Nishara & Milus use magic to turn the flames silver.
