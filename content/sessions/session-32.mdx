Leaving Karrlakton behind, the crew of the _Greg Scott_, minus Darcy d'Deneith, continues on their journey.
Heading onwards to Thrane, the group decides to take High Cardinal Krozen up on his offer of employment.
Arriving in the marble city, the group sits down with Nishara's step father, Grordad for a nice lunch.

Stomachs full, the group continues on to the cathedral of the Silver Flame, where they meet with Calmorn and High Cardinal Krozen.
Krozen begins to give some details on the job at hand, while Calmorn fetches Lawsten Fallon, a friend of the church who is willing to work as well.
Lawsten joins in with the group as they all learn about the job: Krozen wants them to head into the Goblin nation of Darguun to investigate the eyeballs that have been appearing on people's skin.
Accepting the job offer, Krozen shows the group around the church, introducing them to Jaela Daran, the 12 year old Keeper of the Flame.
Jaela introduces the group to the story of the Silver Flame's origins, and it quickly becomes obvious that despite her position, Krozen keeps her in the dark surrounding important day to day goings-on.

As the tour wraps up, Krozen gives the adventures a down payment for their services and allows them to select a magical item from the Silver Flame's reserves.
Olivier, as per usual, offers Krozen some wild weed, which he thoroughly seems to enjoy as the group leaves the Church.
The group, now with Fallon in tow, heads south to find the eyes.

In his sleep, Milus gets a dream that shows him a quicker method of construction on the magical sword he has been working on.
Waking up, he quickly puts his new knowledge to work, finishing up the sword in no time at all.
