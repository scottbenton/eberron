};

This session, the group decides to continue on foot through the labyrinth, with their Ghaash'kala guide Rall joining along.
Making their way through the twisting canyons, a decision is made to sleep in a cave on the first night.
Checking the cave out, the group finds the flying demon who charmed Olivier last session, still nursing its wounds.
The group learns that whenever demons are killed, they are quickly reborn in Khyber to make their way back out into the world.
Killing the demon, they bed down for the night in the now cleared out cave.

Continuing onwards, the group has nothing but surprisingly clear skies and easy travels over the next couple of days.
The few stray infernal entities they encounter are easy to navigate around or hide from until passed by.

At the end of the third day of travel, the group comes upon the Lake of Fire, and spots an entrance to Cannith's lab up on the side of the volcano.
Climbing up the cliff face, the party eventually reaches the platform, and takes out the two warforged guards with a clever illusory floor and a distraction.
Entering the Cannith compound, the group comes across a group of warforged that are resting, and despite Olivier's efforts to blend in, end up in a fight, destroying the warforged almost instantly.
The session ends with the group taking the last remaining warforged as a prisoner to help them navigate the Cannith base.
