Avanth d'Cannith, grandson of the great Merrix d'Cannith has been found dead west of Lake Dark.
House Cannith agents, who found his body, report that the airship he was flying in seems to have fallen from the sky late last week.
No survivors were found, and it appeared that most of the crew died on impact with the ground.

Avanth's body was found with intense electrical burns across it not caused by the crash, and chunks of the airship appear to have been blown off.
While House Cannith said they are still investigating the events leading up to the crash, evidence points to a mutiny aboard one of Cannith's vessels may have been to blame.
The attackers, one of whom is believed to be _Darcy Deneith_, disgraced son of _Breven d'Deneith_ took over the _Celeste Noir_ a few weeks ago, killing the captain and kidnapping the crew.

If evidence of foul play is found, House Cannith is expected to present it at this month's meeting of _The Thirteen_, an organizing body for the dragonmarked houses.
The nature of Deneith's involvement is still unknown at the current moment, but if proven, could inflame tensions further between the two houses.

Avanth, an only child, is survived only by his father, Tomlin Cannith.
