Finishing up the repairs at _Teryk_, the patched up _Celeste Noir_ continued on towards Karrlakton.
Landing just outside of the town, members of the Deneith family were present as the airship touched down, uncertain of who was on board.
Finding Darcy on board, one of the cousins escorted the group back to Sentinel Tower where they met with Breven, Darcy's father.

As the group discussed their journey since joining Angelica on the ship back in Sharn, Breven listened intently.
Upon learning of the group's hand in the recent destruction of the _Lune d'Or_, and the death of Avanth d'Cannith, Breven recommends either disguising or ditching the airship.
Breven also lets the group know that there is a meeting of the Thirteen, where dragonmarked houses work together to mediate disputes, in three weeks time.
He finds it likely that Merrix d'Cannith, one of the leaders of the house, will bring murder charges against Darcy and the group there.
Breven also concludes that bringing proof of the artifact's nature, and proof of its creation by Avanth could be useful in building a case against Cannith, which Breven has been working on already.

With this discussion over, the group decides to rename the _Celeste Noir_ to _The Greg Scott_ (not my idea), ordering its sleek dark hull to be repainted with flame decals to "make it go faster".
They also plan to return to the wreckage of the _Lune d'Or_ in order to find out where Cannith's base in the Labyrinth could be hidden.
