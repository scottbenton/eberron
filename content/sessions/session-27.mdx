As the group tends to their various business in Flamekeep, Milus gets a visit from Calmorn, the wizard the group had transported from Thronehold to Flamekeep a week prior.
Grateful for their help, Calmorn had mentioned the group to High Cardinal Krozen, the current regent of the nation of Thrane.
Seeing the _Greg Scott_ back in town, the two have ventured over to offer future employment to the group, including investigating new reports of goblins in Darguun manifesting unexplained extra eyeballs.
After the group returns and takes the message from Calmorn, the _Greg Scott_ continues on its journey towards Karrlakton.

After taking a night's sleep in Karrlakton, Darcy is awoken early for a meeting with his father Breven, and his aunt Mariella.
Recounting the events of the past week, Darcy brings both of them up to speed with what was found in the Cannith Lab, and introduces them to Aubrey.
With the extra evidence found, Breven seems optimistic that, with Mariella functioning as Darcy's lawyer, the trial can be successful.

After breakfast with the rest of the group, it is decided that Darcy and Milus will be the two party members to testify before The Thirteen.
Due to Olivier's untrustworthy nature, and both Olivier's and Nishara's disdain for powerful authority, neither would be good witnesses.
In addition to Darcy and Milus, it is also decided that Aubrey and Tom can also be used as witnesses.

Over the course of the next few days, the group narrows down on their defense strategy - to use House Cannith's misdeeds as a reason for the crimes the group has committed.
The following main points are drafted up:

---

### Cannith Misdeeds

1. House Cannith is in violation of the _Treaty of Thronehold_ by using a Creation Forge to produce more warforged. Aubrey is proof of this transgression.
2. Klara d'Cannith, while her true identity is unknown, was working with Avanth and the others. Both Tom and Aubrey can testify to this.
3. Explaining the Arcane Sundial, and its potential use in a future war can also help provide motive.

### Crimes the Group has Committed

1. Mutiny
2. Commandeering a stolen airship
3. Murder
4. Destruction of Cannith Property
5. Breaking & Entering
6. Kidnapping

### Information Left Out

1. The existence of Echo
2. The Sovereign of Shadows
3. The theft of thousands of gold worth of dragonshards, gold, and tools from the Cannith Lab
4. The fact that the _Celeste Noir_ fired first when fighting the _Lune d'Or_

As this information is drafted up, Milus moves his base of operations into the basement of House Deneith to continue his work on the sword.
Nishara spends some time with Echo, and asks them to deliver money to their family in the event that something goes wrong.
Olivier sets out to steal a house ring off of the finger of one of Deneith's soldiers.
This plan, of course, goes horribly wrong, and after a quick chase by a tired, but angry Deneith, Olivier teleports back over to the _Greg Scott_, changing his features in order to mask the crime he has committed.
