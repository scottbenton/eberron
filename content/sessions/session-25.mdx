Picking back up where last session ended off, the group becomes acquainted with the Soulforged created from the quori-filled gems.
As the Greg Scott pulls in to pick them up, the group gathers up supplies from the Cannith Lab, including a workbench of cleaning, some tools of mending, and a spherical object of unknown purpose.
Grabbing Rall and leaving the Cannith Lab behind, the group entered back into the Labyrinth.

Inside the Labyrinth, the group found themselves in the middle of a dust storm.
Traveling through the falling dust, Nishara used some of their sorcery powers to aid the sight of the ship, making travel easier.
Nearly out of the Labyrinth, the group encountered another powerful demon that attacks the ship, bringing much of the group low in health using bolts of lighting that jump from person to person.
In the midst of battle, the demon banishes Rall and Darcy to another plane of existence, where spend a few seconds having a heart to heart before the demon loses concentration and they fall back into the real world.

Finishing the demon off, the group continues on their way.
