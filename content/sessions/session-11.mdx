Travelling to Q'Barra, the group spends a night in the town of Whitecliff, learning that House Tharashk runs a dragonshard mining operation there.
On the way out in the morning, they drop Corric d'Cannith in the forest, close enough to civilization to allow him to survive, but far enough to keep him out of commission for a while.

Continuing on to Krona Peak in the Mror Holds, the group is met by a small group of dwarves upon landing.
One of the dwarves, who later introduces himself as Leir dâ€™Kundarak, asks for Angelica, claiming that she owes him money.
Upon realizing that the group cannot afford the high cost of unlocking the _Gauntlet of Transposition_, and that Angelica had no intention of paying, Leir asks who the gauntlet would be safer with.
Disagreeing on the answer, Leir decides a bit of a contest is in order. If the group can defeat a group of Warforged, and then Leir himself then they can take the gauntlet.

Following Leir up the side of the mountain, the group eventually finds themselves on an outcropping, where they are met with a group of warforged.
The first half of the challenge commences, and the warforged group is defeated, mostly through Milus's introduction of Dr. Bot, an arcane cannon that shoots healing?
I'm not sure how that works either, but its cool.

Upon defeating the warforged, Leir begins part two of the challenge, as a giant construct rises out of the rock behind the group.
