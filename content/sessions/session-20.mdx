Still in the Cranky Kenku, Nishara contacts Calmorn, informing him that someone wants him dead.
Calmorn and Nishara craft a plan, where Calmorn will feign his death in a pit battle against Darcy.
In return, the crew will drop Calmorn off in Thrane.

Despite the rest of the group only having bits and pieces of Nishara's plan, Darcy and Calmorn face off in a pit fight.
Calmorn casts _Feign Death_ at a pivotal moment in the fight, giving Darcy the win, and completing his end of the bargain.
With Calmorn's supposed death, Dutchess Volnia keeps her end of the bargain up, and informs Nishara that there is a Cannith base hidden under the Lake of Fire in the Labyrinth.

After a night's rest, the _Greg Scott_ takes back off with Calmorn in tow, heading towards the nearby city of Flamekeep.
Arriving and letting Calmorn off, Nishara heads out into the city, searching for family & friends around.
Coming across a one-armed dwarf working on a statue, Nishara recognizes Grordoic, her stepfather.
Grordoic embraces Nishara, updating her on Nymm and Thea, before gently berating her once learning she wasn't going to come visit the rest of the family.
Leaving her family behind, the group heads back off into danger, flying once again towards the Labyrinth.
