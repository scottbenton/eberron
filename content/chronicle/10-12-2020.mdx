According to members of the Mroranon Clan, Arbiter of the Iron Council Torlan Mroranon descended into the old dwarven kingdom below Krona peak three days ago, and has yet to resurface.
Torlan, 267 years old, has been among the leaders of the Clan since before the Last War broke out, taking control about 24 years before the Treaty of Thronehold was signed.
Mroranon also holds leadership over the Iron Council, and has been a steadfast voice over his term.
While his fellow dwarves would not say why the leader entered into Mroranonhold, the ancient Dwarven city is rumored to contain great riches and powerful artifacts left by the dwarves that died there.

Mroranonhold, once a Dwarven stronghold, fell to the armies of the Daelkyr during The Exile of the Twelve.
Upon the ending of the exile, the clans discovered the fallen strongholds and the beasts that now inhabited them.
Since gaining their independence during the war, the Iron Council has focused on driving out the Daelkyr and regaining their ancient seats.

If Torlan is not found, his either daughter Mirilan, 138, or brother Parak, 246, is likely to take his place as head of Mroranon.

Anyone with any information is urged to contact Sentinel Marshall Wren d'Deneith as soon as possible.
