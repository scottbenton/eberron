Picking up after taking the warforged captured last session, deep inside a base run by House Cannith, the group also finds and captures two of House Cannith's artificers.
Searching through the nearby rooms, Olivier and Nishara find some letters between Avanth and Aubrey, checking in, and find a few papers of magical research and a map of the continent in Klara's room.
Finding that Klara's bed is still warm, further searching of the headboard reveals a secret passageway, which the group follows, safely detonating a trap and making it into the room beyond.

Entering into the room, the group sees Klara and a deactivated mech holding two tower shields.
Surprised by the group's nighttime invasion, Klara, still in her pajamas, escapes out a door into a large storage, pursued by Nishara.
Entering the storage room, Nishara finds Klara activating a 25 foot tall **Warforged Titan** to help with her defense.
In the other room, Milus reactivates the mech with the tower shields, "hacking" it to help protect the group against the Titan.

The mech battle commences, and as both sides wear each other down Nishara convinces Klara to stop fighting.
Unable to deactivate the giant warforged, the group eventually takes it down, as Darcy delivers the final blow.
As the body of the mechanical titan finally grinds to a halt on the cold stone floor, Klara reveals that she is not indeed a Cannith, and is, just like Olivier, a changeling.
