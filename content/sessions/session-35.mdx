The _Greg Scott_ makes its way towards the gobin ruins where the eyeball cultists have been organizing themselves.
Arriving, they find the ruins crawling with more of the creatures and cultists present in the town.
Also present around the ruins is another group of adventurers, three goblins and a hobgoblin that are also looking to take down the cultists and free Darguun.

Teaming up with the goblins, the group fights their way through the crowd of cultists, making their way to the front door of the temple.
As the odds of the battle turn against the cultists, one of the tentacle creatures turns and runs further into the ruins.
