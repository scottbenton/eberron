The Celeste Noir lands in Gatherhold, where the Halfling celebration of "The Merriment" is taking place.
Delia goes to meet with a halfling tribe she had allied herself with, while the rest of the group spreads out into the crowd.

Nishara spends time performing as a fortune teller, gathering gold from the drunken crowds in exchange for fortunes.
In doing so, they meet another Khalashtar that is doing the same.
Darcy and Olivier join a drinking competition, and in doing so, secure Silas's support for the mutiny.

As the group meets back up, they learn that Delia has failed to secure the halfling tribe's help, due to the death of a few of their members earlier in the campaign.
Deciding to continue on with the mutiny, the session ends as Olivier is wrapped up in a bear hug.
