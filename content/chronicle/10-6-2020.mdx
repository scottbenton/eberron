Most know of Q'Barra as a chaotic place on the frontier, where settlers and refugees alike have gone to get rich.
The discovery of Dragonshards in the area, in addition to the war displacing thousands from their homes led to a massive influx in new settlers to the area.
People came from across the continent to try their luck at finding deposits of the dragonshards, some bringing their families and friends with them as well.
Settlements sprang up overnight, transforming into sprawling successful towns such as Whitecliff.
Even the dragonmarked houses have began to move into the area, with House Tharashk starting up dragonshard recovery operations of its own.

Outside of the settlements though, the dense jungles of Q'Barra hold many secrets.
Tribes of Lizardfolk, previously unknown to the rest of the continent, haven't taken too kindly to the fortune seekers.
Many spats have sprung up over the years between the lizardfold and the settlers.
Dragonborn, a race of draconic, scaly creatures with a proud militant background also live in the area of Q'Barra, but tend to keep to themselves.
Despite tensions rising in recent years as more and more settlers enter Q'Barra, an all out war has not broken out yet in the region.

In addition to its lucrative dragonshard industry and interesting inhabitants, Q'Barra also offers another tantalizing secret: knowledge.
Our team followed intrepid explorer Illinois Johns on a raid of a ruin.
Inside the ruin that, by best estimates, appears to be from the Age of Demons, we found all sorts of traps that had managed to survive the passage of time.
Despite nearly triggering a couple of the deadly traps, Illinois and I managed to overcome the obstacles and escape the ruin with an unidentified magical artifact, and more importantly, our lives.

It is estimated that little over 8% of Q'Barra has been explored by the settlers, and some of the unconfirmed stories about what remains undiscovered in the jungles seem to be based more in nightmare than reality.
