# Lawsten's Knowledge

Here is a vague collection of things that you would have learned / experienced since awakening.
Let me know if you have any other questions, or if any of this doesn't match what you planned.

## The Mournland / Your First Memories

Awakening into the thick mists of the Mournland was a confusing experience.
The voice in your head pulled you through the thick mists, slowly helping you tap into a greater source of power.
This power allowed you to defend your self from threats in the mists.
Living spells posed a large threat, as did the mutilated minds and bodies of various animals trapped in the shattered grounds of the Mournland.

Only the consistent voice of your god allowed you to pull through, guiding you out of the Mournland onto safer grounds.
Ever since, the voice has become less and less talkative, offering guidance more sporadically as you become more and more confident in your abilities.

## Thrane

Depending on how long you have been in Thrane, you may have caught on to the fact that The Church of the Silver Flame's influence is waning.
Despite Thrane's from a monarchy to a theocracy during the last war, the heir to the throne Diani ir'Wynarn plots a return to power for the royal bloodline.
Thrane's ability to keep perceived evils at bay seems to be lessening as well, as stronger and stronger enemies rise.
Atop all of this, the current head of state, and Keeper of the Flame is an 11 year old girl named _Jaela Daran_.

Jaela, while you've only met her a time or two, is an impressive child.
Despite being naive at times, and, due to her age, unfit for to fully lead Thrane, she often seems uncannily prescient, and carries an air of mysticism around her.
Ruling in her stead for the moment, is _High Cardinal Krozen_.

Krozen is a bit of a mystery to you so far.
He has been nothing but polite to you, opening up the libraries to you, and even putting resources towards attempting to restore your memory.
Despite this, you have heard rumors that he orchestrated Jaela's takeover, and uses her inability to rule as an excuse to hold power.
Your research has not unearthed much in this regard.

_Calmorn_ arrived only recently, and as another outsider to the church hungry for knowledge, often spends his time in the libraries along side you.
While he tends to keep to himself, when he does talk, he talks of dreams.
Dreams that tend to offer inspiration, leading him to new pursuits of magical abilities that are unlike anything you have seen before.

About a week or so ago, The High Cardinal came to talk to each of you about a plague of eyes that had appeared in the Goblin nation of Darguun.
While the Treaty of Thronehold barred Thrane from sending in the Silver Flame's resources without Darguun's permission, Krozen explained that you could help.
Should you desire, the Church will happily pay you to join a group of adventurers headed to Darguun to study the threat.

## The Symbol

The symbol on your chest is a mystery to you.
While it does vaguely resemble a dragonmark, it does not match the dragonmarks of any known houses.
Abberant dragonmarks, thought to be extinct, were also ruled out, as the symbol itself seems inert, not holding any power as a typical dragonmark would.
Continuing with that logic, the symbol itself doesn't seem to have any magical power, although attempts to alter or remove the mark so far have failed.

As a purely visual tattoo, the intricate series of interconnecting lines isn't bad looking, but there doesn't seem to be an aesthetic rhyme or reason to it.
While it isn't evident one way or another, the evidence so far points to a purpose behind the symbol, as of yet undetermined.
