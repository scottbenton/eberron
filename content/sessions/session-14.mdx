The party, along with Delia and Wren, talk to the emaciated dwarf in armor at the entrance to the chamber.
Urging them to leave, it is revealed that the dwarf doesn't have control over its own body, and against the head's wishes, the body turns, and leads the group deeper into the chamber.
As the group climbs the steps into a large, open room, the door shuts behind them.
Taking in their surroundings, the group sees a few more dwarven guards, seemingly tasked with protecting Torlan Mroranon.
Torlan's body rises up from the back of the room, weird fleshy tentacles writhing from its mouth, and the tentacles release a psychic blast that leaves half of the party stunned.

Combat is laced with the dwarven guards, unable to control their own bodies, slowly dragging stunned victims towards Torlan, while the party fights back against them and Torlan.
Darcy, overcoming being stunned, manages to grab hold of the tentacles and grapple the creature that has taken over Torlan's body.
Finally knocking out the remaining guards, the group watches in horror as Delia is struck by a tentacle, and then is pulled in as the creature abandons Torlan's body for Delia's, killing her in the process.
Wren finishes the creature by shooting an arrow through Delia's head, hitting the main body of it, and finally ending its life.

The end of the session is reached as the group realizes that Delia is well and truly dead.
