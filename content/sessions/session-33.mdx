Heading southwards towards Darguun, the _Greg Scott_ heads past Gorgonhorn, flying close enough to try to see what has changed since their last visit.
Flying by, smoke from the still burning fires is seen floating up from Gorgonhorn.
Fallon, looking into the village, spots a large group of eyeball cultists patrolling the cinders of the town.
Towards the edge of the town a goblin family makes their escape towards the forest.

Instructing Orvil to fly over the goblins, the group feather falls down on top of the goblin family, helping to bring them to the relative safety of the brush outside of town.
Offering the goblins shelter on the ship, the group sends the goblins ahead to meet Orvil while Fallon tries, and fails, to get a closer look at the town.
Hearing screams from the woods behind them, the group turns and runs after the goblins, finding the family under attack by a Gorgon, a large grey Bull whose toxic breath can turn beings into stone.
Seeing the danger that the family is in, as the father of the family is already a statue, as the other two goblins cower away from the beast, the group attacks the gorgon.

A successful banishment from Fallon gets one of the beasts off their back for a minute while a secondary gorgon charges into the clearing as well.
Fighting off the second beast, the group prepares as Fallon's spell fades, bringing the first gorgon back.
Attacking, and successfully killing the second gorgon, the group heads back to the _Greg Scott_, hauling the statue of a goblin along with them.
