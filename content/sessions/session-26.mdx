As the group continues on their journey, Darcy asks Milus if some components gathered from the Cannith Lab can be put to use in a sword.
Collaborating, the two create a plan for a magical rapier, and Milus begins to put together his new workshop to aid in the creation of such an object.
Darcy also identifies a smooth circular ball taken from the Cannith lab, finding it to be a docent, which will allow a warforged access to a lot of knowledge from around the world of Eberron.
Installing the docent in their new soulforged friend, the soulforged decides on the name "Echo", due to their new role as a historian.

Continuing onwards, Darcy purchases a rapier for usage in the sword, and Nishara reaches out to their family, asking for a meeting in Flamekeep as the group returns towards Karrlakton.
As Milus continues working, sword now in hand, the group enters Flamekeep and heads about their business.

Olivier and Darcy go shopping for magic items, purchasing up a bag that seems to contain all sorts of furry creatures.
While the shopkeeper's back is turned, Olivier grabs a small stone that cleans off anyone who touches it, as well as an old grimy coin.
Leaving the store, Olivier decides to try a bit of the drugs purchased in Thronehold, and tries some wild weed.
Walking through the town, feathers begin to grow and float off of Olivier as the drug takes hold, causing a surge of wild magic.

Meanwhile, Nishara meets with their family in a nice little bakery, where Nymm and her snapping turtle Water Lily are causing some chaos.
Sitting down and catching up with Grordoic and Thea, Nishara receives a few fresh capes from their family.
The session comes to a close as the family enjoys a nice meal together.
