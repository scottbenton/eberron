Cannith forces struck Sentinel Tower, the seat of Deneith power last night in an attack that has left hundreds dead, and House Deneith reeling.
This bold move marks an escalation in the war that started after Darcy d'Deneith was acquitted for the death of Avanth d'Cannith.
Before yesterday, the war primarily has been waged in the streets of Khorvaire, without large scale conflicts coming close to either house's centers.
Cannith's aggressive actions mark an escalation in a war that has already left many dead, and led to a general sense of fear among the populace.

Details about the attack and its impacts are still developing, but it appears that portions of Sentinel Tower have collapsed.
Members of House Deneith reportedly began evacuating the tower last night after guards on patrol noticed growing cracks in the foundation.
Cannith forces detonated explosives in hollowed out areas, destabilizing the structure even further.
Outside, Cannith forces arriving by airship faced heavy resistance from Deneith defenses, who have been preparing for an assault from the air for months.
Although House Deneith has repelled House Cannith for the moment, questions remain about their ability to continue fighting against the arcanically superior House.

These questions are potentially validated by the rumors that House Patriarch Breven d'Deneith was killed or gravely injured in the fighting yesterday.
As Karrlakton burns, and one of the two giant statues that graced Sentinel Tower's walls lays in rubble, one thing is clear: Cannith has struck a significant blow in this war.
