  sessionTitle: "The Eyes",
};

This session started in the middle of combat between the eye cultists, but was quickly interrupted by the arrival of the Cult Leaders.
The main leader appeared to be a small, floating green creature with a singular eye in the center of a mass of tentacles.
The other appeared to be more of the legs of the operation, a withered, brown creature with no eyes.

With the leaders arrival, the two groups negotiated a truce - both parties would leave the town.
The group headed back to the ship, where they found chaos had ensued in the time since they had left.

After learning that a guard on board the ship had been killed, the group's suspicions were confirmed when Delia admitted to killing the man.
Admonishing her, the group also learned that she had been planting explosives on board the ship.
Delia desired to drop the ship into Lake Cyre when it reached the other side of the Mournland in order to force an emergency landing at Gatherhold, where she could meet up with allies.
Angelica, due to the killing of the guard, asked the group members to double their guard efforts surrounding the disk.

The group, fearing the damage that could be caused by the explosive devices disarms them all, and plans to replace them with less destructive means of forcing the ship to Gatherhold.
Entering the misty airspace of The Mournland, The Celeste Noir continues on its journey.
