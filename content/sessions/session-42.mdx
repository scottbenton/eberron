Snooping around Flamekeep, looking for clues on who has infiltrated the Church, the group finds evidence that one of the Cardinals is meeting someone outside the church tonight.
Tracking the evidence back to Cardinal Mitul, the group questions him, and learns that he is also looking for an infiltrator from the Sovereign of Shadows.
Mitul believes that a Raksasha must be hiding out in the church, due to their especially sly nature and ability to hide from low level spells.
As the group discusses various plans and theories, Mitul heads to High Cardinal Krozen's office to retrieve staffing logs.

Returning from his search, Mitul reports nothing of interest, but hands off files on each of the players.
These files appear to be background checks, containing important information such as the location of Nishara's family, and the list of crimes Olivier has commited.
As the group looks over their files, Mitul is attacked, as a Raksasha pops into view with its claws dug into Mitul's chest.
