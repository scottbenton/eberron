As the ship travels over the Mournland, Milus begins sabotaging the ship so that he can force a landing in Gatherhold.
While he is working, the rest of the group defends the ship from a few monsters ascending from the mists below.
Successfully defeating the misty spirits and the blackened burned skeleton, the group retired back below deck.

Delia met with the group, proposing a mutiny when they land in Gatherhold.
After a discussion, and some convincing, the group began to form alliances with some of their friends on the ship, hoping for a relatively seamless transfer of power.
