  sessionTitle: "The Assassination",
};

The session begins as the group faces off against the large metallic snake that has just burst from a nearby building, a Cannith artificer on the building next to it.
As the fight begins, it quickly becomes clear that both the artificer and the serpent are both targeting Darcy.
This attack appears to be an assassination attempt.
Everything becomes even more dire as a second snake bursts from another building across the square, and begins attacking the group as well.

Although one serpent is eventually brought down by the group's efforts, the other manages to knock Darcy unconscious, continuing to bite at him on the ground.
Darcy then fails a final death saving throw, and the group watches as their friend takes his final breaths.
As Kaiden joins the fight, slicing the final snake in half, Milus begins questioning the surviving Cannith artificers, seeing if they know how to trap souls into gemstones.
While neither of them seem able to complete the task, the surrounding guards suggest bringing Darcy's body back up to the trial chamber, suggesting that one of the dragonmarked leaders may be able to help.

Racing Darcy's body up the stairs, Olivier bursts back into the chamber, causing surprise to much of the assembled council that remains in the chamber.
Ulara d'Jorasco, the Baron of the halfling house of Healing quickly manages to gather the diamonds required to cast revivify, and does so, bringing Darcy back to life.
In the meantime, Darcy's father Breven, draws his sword, and quickly moves towards Merrix d'Cannith, accusing him of being behind Darcy's murder.

As tensions quickly rise in the room, and swords are drawn, Breven tosses his sword at the feet of Merrix, a declaration of war between houses that has only happened once prior.
With Darcy revived, the Deneith group quickly leaves the chambers, collecting a force of guards, killing the would be assassins, and bringing everyone back to the `Greg Scott`, where Darcy is left to rest and recover.

As the _Greg Scott_ starts to head back to _Karrlakton_, its pilot, Orvil, removes his dragonmarked house ring out of fear that his house will make him fight in the war, taking him away from Olivier.
