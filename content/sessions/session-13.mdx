};

As Milus works with a local blacksmith to make a custom shield, the rest of the group wanders around Krona Peak.
Nishara hears a town crier discuss [the disappearance of Torlan Mroranon](/chronicle/12-sypheros-997), and decides to discuss the event with the group.
Milus finishes up his new shield, and the group heads off to find Wren d'Deneith, a second cousin of Darcy's.

Entering the House Deneith stronghold, Wren gives Darcy a hard time about his excommunication from the house, but readily accepts their help in finding Torlan.
Leading the group through the city streets, Wren takes them to an entrance into Mroranonhold.
Guarded by a unit of dwarves, the strong stone door is opened only long enough to let the group enter, closing behind the group.

Entering the dark, dusty interior, it doesn't take long before the group hears the voice of someone claiming to be Torlan, leading the group further into the old dwarven hold.
A figure also appears to the group, staying just far enough ahead of them to stay out of sight except for occasional glimpses of a short, stout, dwarf.
In following the figure, the group fights off a couple groups of monsters before finding their way into a large chamber.
The session ends as the party sees a sickly thin dwarf, staring off into the room.
