As the group waits for the repairs to be finished, and for the newly rechristened _Greg Scott_ to be painted, everyone spends some time around Karrlakton.

**Nishara**

Nishara spends some time wandering around Karrlakton, trying to get a better feel for the locals, who are rather closed off, but not unkind.
They also send some money to their family, warning their parents not to mention Nishara for fear of Cannith retaliation.

**Milus**

Milus spends the day wandering around Sentinel Tower, getting a feel for the small artificer operation set up in the basement, and viewing some of the art on the walls.
One of the pieces of art catches his eye, a piece of art depicting Darcy's family.
Upon closer inspection, Milus catches a glance of a pendant around Darcy's mothers neck, containing a familiar looking symbol.
The symbol is a match for the runes present in the chamber the group found underneath the Mror Holds.

**Olivier**

Olivier spends the day performing magic tricks on the streets of Karrlakton.
The somewhat stiff locals quickly relax as they watch the tricks in wonder, giving Olivier some extra cash.

---

**Darcy**

Darcy spends the day watching over the repairs and repainting occurring on the ship.

The next morning, Milus pulls Olivier aside, sharing the information about Darcy's mother's pendant.
Olivier casts _comprehend languages_ on a drawing of the pendant, learning that the symbol on the floor is a containment symbol, meant to hold back something.

As the group returns to the airship, they decide to head onwards towards The Labyrinth, with the next stop being in Thronehold.
