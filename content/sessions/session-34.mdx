As the group recovers from the gorgon encounter, the group talks to the two goblins recovered from Gorgonhorn.
The goblins tell them that in addition to drawing eyeballs on some goblin's heads, the cultist slowly escalated their tactics, eventually merging pairs of the surviving goblins into one mindless being, and burning the town down.

The group, learning this information, decides to try and get a better handle on how large the scope of the issue is.
Traveling North to Kennrun, the group quickly discerns from the air that there appears to be no danger yet to the heavily guarded town.
Turning around, debating heading towards Skullreave, the group eventually decides to go back to Gorgonhorn to tackle the problem in town.
After a period of debate, Olivier comes up with a plan that the others agree to - impersonating a cultist, and trying to get the small floating eyeball creature to come with him.

Making his way down to the ground, Olivier approaches the the cultists, eventually making his way over to the floating eyeball creature.
Claiming that the Sovereign of Shadows is nearby, and wants to talk to him, Olivier successfully convinces a now terrified eyeball to dimension door with him.
Olivier dimension doors the eyeball up to the Greg Scott, where a vague illusion of the Sovereign of Shadows is used to scare the small eyeball into a cell, captured.
Questioning the monster, they learn that the eyeballs boss is set up in some nearby ruins.
