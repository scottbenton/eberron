As Mitul falls backwards, dead, the fight starts in earnest between the Raksasha and the party.
Quickly realizing that their spells won't be of much use, Milus uses his power armor to grapple the beast to the ground, while Nishara pulls a magical chandelier down on top of him.
Finding that the Everbright Lantern's magical properties bypass the Raksasha's wards, the group begins beating him with the lanterns.
Recognizing that he has underestimated his foes, the Raksasha casts _Plane Shift_ and vanishes from view, leaving the group behind.

The group immediately reports their findings to Krozen.
Suspecting the Keeper of the Flame, Jaela Daran of being the Raksasha, the group reaches out to her via sending.
The response they hear is in Jaela's voice, but quickly distorts back into the Raksasha, who realizes they have been found out.
