  sessionTitle: "Capture the Kobold!",
};

As the group waits for Snappy Joe's arrival, Milus and Lawsten decide to take the satyrs up on their offer of a game of Capture the Kobold.
Heading back into The Twilight Demesne, the two meet up once again with the satyrs and centaurs and begin the game.
Right off of the bat, Lawsten calls upon his god to aid them in the game, and the god oblidges.
Maniesting as a short, ginger, dwarf, Lawsten's god immediately grabs the Kobold and rushes it towards the goal, smiting a centaur and pushing a satyr into croc infested waters along the way.
Seeing the slaughter of their friend, the other opposing team splits and runs, allowing Lawstens god to dunk the Kobold and win.
Learning that murder was perhaps not the way to go in the game, Lawsten's god ressurects the fallen centaur in a seemingly painful way, before vanishing.
Leaving the feywild, Lawsten and Milus agree to not speak about what just happened.

With still two weeks remaining before Snappy Joe arives at the Twilight Demesne, the group decides to return to Flamekeep to root out the Sovereign of Shadow's implanted people there.
Deciding to start in the library, the group talks to the librarian Danny, and the wizard Calmorn for more information.
The group learns the following relevant information:

- Similarly to Milus, Calmorn has been learning new magical abilities in his dreams, as have the mages at the Floating Towers of Arcanix.
- Jaela checks out religious texts fairly often at the library, but High Cardinal Krozen does not.
- Calmorn has been running drugs for Krozen.
- The church and the crown are at odds over who should rule Thrane.

With this information in hand, Lawsten casts Arcane Eye, and the session ends as the spectral eye begins floating through the marble hallways.
