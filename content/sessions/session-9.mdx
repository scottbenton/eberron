};

In the middle of a heist, the group has entered into a halfling leaders house to steal a woven dinosaur.
As the mimic transforms, it bites off one of Finn's hands.
The rest of the group manages to get ahold of and spirit the dinosaur away and out of the house.
Giving the dinosaur to the tribe leader who hired Dok, Vulf, and Finn in the first place, the group decides to head back to the Celeste Noir.

Arriving on the ship, the group finds no sign of Delia.
A quick sweep of the decks revealed that Angelica and Corric had captured her, finding signs of Milus's sabotage in the process.
After a failed attempt to convince Angelica and Corric of their loyalty, the group attacked the pair.
Corric was quickly knocked out, and Angelica captured when Aubrey, drawn by the noise also entered the lower deck of the ship.
Aubrey kills Angelica with a crossbow bolt before the group can obtain any information from the captain, before fleeing off the ship into the night.

Nishara, in hot pursuit, learns from Aubrey that she had been working directly with House Cannith.
Aubrey had been hired by members of the house to keep a keen eye on Angelica, and, apparently, silence her should her knowledge become a threat.

After a successful mutiny, the group finally has control over the Celeste Noir.
