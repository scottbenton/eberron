Packing up the ship, the crew returns to Flamekeep.
Entering the city, the group finds that war has come, as parts of the city are in flame.
Fighting between the Cannith and Deneith houses has taken its toll, and the group decides to continue onwards towards the Cathedral of the Silver Flame instead of getting involved.

Approaching the marble steps, the group catches sight of a cloaked figure watching them.
Seeing he has been spotted, the figure turns to run, but is quickly caught and revealed to be Corric d'Cannith, coming for revenge.
A group of fighters working for him ambushes you, and nearly takes out the party before most are killed.
The session ends as the group approaches the unconscious Cannith.
