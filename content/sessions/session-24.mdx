As combat ends, the group begins chatting with the changeling Klara d'Cannith.
Discussing recent events, the group learns that Klara is working for a being known as the _Sovereign of Shadows_.
Her goal has been to reignite the last war, and hoped to use the arcane sundial to be able to ramp up tensions between the nations.
Despite the sundial being firmly and safely in the hands of the party, Klara is still optimistic.
Her hope is that the party's recent killing of Avanth and current breaking and entering of a Cannith base should be more than enough to escalate tensions between dragonmarked houses, potentially starting a house war.

Nishara, interested in helping out the Quori spirits used to power the sundial, asks Klara if they can be extracted.
Klara suggests the usage of the Creation Forge, a creation of House Cannith that places souls into the bodies of the warforged.
With the help of the captured artificers Tom and Lenny, Klara believes the group may be able to transfer the souls into the body of a warforged.

As Nishara and Milus go to fetch the tied up artificers, Klara decides to make her escape.
Darcy, prepared for such an eventuality, casts sleep on Klara, but is thwarted by a reactionary spell by Klara.
This spell appears to turn back time, blocking Darcy's spell from being cast.
As Klara makes her escape through a conjured portal, Darcy slashes her once more in the back, nearly felling the enemy.

The artificers all begin work on the Creation Forge, hoping to retrofit it with the ability to pull souls from the gems.
The first attempt fails, and as Milus pours over the parts and pieces, Darcy and Olivier break into a safe in the compound, gaining a lot of money, and enough dragonshards to craft a couple of magic items.

After taking a quick rest, Milus and the other artificers are able to fix their mistakes, and Tom suggests using a spare soul gem Klara kept to test.
Darcy, fetching the gem, realizes that the gem contains the soul of Aubrey, and discusses letting her out in exchange for her testimony in front of the Council of the 13.
Aubrey agrees, and the Creation Forge is fired up, transferring her soul into the warforged.
With one success under their belts, the group decides to transfer all of the souls from the quori gems into the large mech that Milus revitalized last session.
This process succeeds, and the session ends as the newly created Soulforged begin to take stock of the new body.
