To outsiders, the war between the nations of Riedra and Adar seems like a confusing mess stemming from political disagreements.
Both nations are largely human, and the largest differences at first glance appear to be in forms of government.
The empire of Riedra is a totalitarian state, whereas the nation of Adar is alarmingly decentralized, with no formal government leading the fractious nation at all.
By all normal metrics, Riedra should have been able to crush the small mountain nation of Adar centuries ago.
And yet, its citizens are the only thing standing between Riedra and full control over the continent, in a fight for power that has spanned nearly a millenia.

While at first glance, most occupants of both nations appear human, some are something more, a merging of quori from the plane of Dal Quor with human bodies and minds.
These duos are often called Kalashtar here in Eberron.
However, in Sarlona, there are two distinct groups of these hybrid humans, one group on each side of the fight.

The Kalashtar people are from Adar.
Most Kalashtar that live here in Khorvaire are descended from refugees of this battle.
From the histories I could find in Sarlona, it is estimated that around 1500 - 2000 years ago a rebellious group of quori left Dal Quor and merged with the first Kalashtar.
Roughly 500 years later, another, antagonistic group followed, joining with people in Riedra.

This group is commonly referred to as the Inspired.
Nowadays, they lead the nation of Riedra as anointed leaders, followed by zealous human worshippers, and bent on destroying the Kalashtar that remain in Adar.

The battle between Riedra and Adar, while it appears on the surface to be a political struggle, is actually a continuation of a conflict that likely began thousands of years ago, on another plane.
At least our war here only lasted a century.
